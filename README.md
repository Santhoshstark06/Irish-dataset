# About the repo 

This repository contains an exploration of the famous Iris Dataset as part of the assessment in the Programming and Scripting module for the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.


# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to better understand the data through statistical and visual analysis in order to form hypotheses and uncover potential patterns in the data (Douieb, 2017). Generally, the first things to look at when confronted with a new dataset are the structure of the dataset and basic information about its contents.

 The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

# Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes heavy use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries.
